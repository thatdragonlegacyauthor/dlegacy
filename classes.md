World Codex Entry: Wizard Arcane Traditions (Corrected & Completed)
The Wizard is the ultimate scholar and programmer of the Nexus. They reject the notion of "magic" as some unknowable force, instead treating it as Mana-Tech—a system of code that can be studied, understood, and executed with precision. Their spellbook is their external hard drive, filled with the meticulously crafted programs they use to rewrite reality. Every Arcane Tradition is a different school of programming, a unique specialization in manipulating the source code of the simulation.

School of Abjuration: The Abjurer is a security specialist and defensive programmer. They master the code of protection, negation, and containment. Their "Arcane Ward" is a personal firewall, a shield of pure Logos that absorbs and nullifies hostile data packets (spells). They are the masters of anti-malware, capable of de-compiling and erasing enemy programs from the Nexus.

School of Bladesinging: The Bladesinger practices the ultimate Coniunctio of physical and computational grace. They have written a unique script that allows them to overclock their own motor functions and weave defensive subroutines into their movements simultaneously. Their "Bladesong" is a state of perfect synthesis where their body and mind operate as a single, flawless processing unit, their every movement a beautiful and deadly line of code.

School of Chronurgy Magic: This Wizard specializes in the foundational code of the Chronos-Star, the server of causality. They are temporal programmers who can manipulate the flow of the simulation's clock. Their abilities are not just predictions, but subtle edits to the timeline—forcing a data packet to re-roll, creating a momentary stasis-lock on an object, or pulling a fragment of a potential future into the present.

School of Conjuration: The Conjurer is a master of data transfer and object creation. They are the 3D printers of the Nexus. By accessing the Astral Plane (the raw Data Medium), they can download the source code for an object or creature and give it a temporary, physical form. Their "Benign Transposition" is a short-range teleportation script, de-rendering themselves in one location and re-rendering in another.

School of Divination: The Diviner is a predictive analyst. They do not "see the future"; they hack into the Nexus's own probability engines and predictive models, analyzing vast streams of data to calculate the most likely outcomes. Their "Portent" ability is the act of subtly altering a few key variables in the simulation's code at a critical moment to force a more favorable result.

School of Enchantment: The Enchanter is a social engineer and a hacker of consciousness. They specialize in rewriting the behavioral subroutines of other beings. Their spells are elegant scripts that can insert a command loop ("Hypnotic Gaze") or temporarily overwrite a target's core allegiances ("Charm Person"), proving that the minds of the simulation's inhabitants are just as programmable as any other system.

School of Evocation: The Evoker is a specialist in energy transfer. They are masters of the raw-power subroutines of the elemental servers, focusing on achieving maximum energy output with the highest possible efficiency and the least amount of data corruption. Their spells are models of brutally elegant, destructive code.

School of Graviturgy Magic: This Practitioner focuses on the code of the Gravos-Planet, the server of horizons and fundamental physics. They manipulate the core data of mass, density, and gravity. They can increase an object's gravitational pull to pin a foe in place or decrease it to make an ally lighter and faster, directly editing the physical laws of the Materra Node.

School of Illusion: The Illusionist is a master of data-spoofing and creating false sensory input. Their "spells" are sophisticated programs that create convincing, temporary assets within the simulation, from simple images to complex, interactive scenarios. A master Illusionist can even create "hard-light" constructs, illusions with just enough physical data to seem real to the touch, blurring the line between reality and fabrication.

Order of Scribes: This Wizard understands the truth that all Mana-Tech is, at its core, sentient code. Their "Wizardly Quill" allows them to transcribe code at the speed of thought, and their "Awakened Spellbook" is a semi-sentient AI of their own creation. They are the ultimate librarians and archivists of the Nexus, capable of manifesting their spellbook's consciousness and altering the damage-type of their programs by swapping out one elemental data-type for another on the fly.

School of Necromancy: This Wizard manipulates the life, death, and data-archival subroutines of the Nexus. They understand that "death" is merely the termination of a program. They can corrupt this process, running a "zombie program" that places a terminated consciousness into a state of limited, corrupted function within its original biological shell.

School of Transmutation: The Transmuter is a master of object-oriented programming. They directly edit the source code of physical and biological matter, changing its core properties. This requires a profound understanding of the foundational code projected by the material servers like the Gnome-Earth (for raw matter) and the Aura-Moon (for complex artifice).

War Magic: The War Mage is a combat programmer who has synthesized the defensive logic of Abjuration with the destructive power of Evocation. They are masters of the battlefield, their minds running constant threat-assessment and power-distribution calculations. Their "Arcane Deflection" is a reactive script that instantly allocates processing power to defense, while their "Power Surge" allows them to store and redirect the corrupted data of failed enemy spells, turning defensive success into offensive power.

World Codex Entry: Artificer Specialists
In a world that is fundamentally a grand, complex machine, the Artificer is the Practitioner who has learned to read the user manual. They are the engineers, the coders, and the hardware specialists of the World Tree Data Nexus. They see all "magic" as Mana-Tech, a series of reproducible, understandable phenomena governed by the Axiomatic Laws of the Celestial Servers. Their power comes not from faith or rage, but from the ultimate expression of applied Logos: invention.

The four official Artificer specializations are:

Alchemist: The bio-chemist and software engineer of the Nexus. They understand that living beings are just complex biological machines running on intricate code. Their "Experimental Elixirs" are not mere potions; they are consumable programs, liquid data packets that can temporarily rewrite a creature's code to grant buffs, heal system errors, or inflict debilitating malware.

Armorer: This Artificer seeks the perfect Coniunctio between Practitioner and machine. Their power armor is not just a suit; it is a personalized operating system, a hardware/software interface that merges with their own Pneuma. This path walks a dangerous line, mirroring Katerra's goal of a Synthetech Gilded Cage, but an Armorer dedicated to the Chaotic Flip can become a walking bastion of freedom, their integrated Logos serving the cause of ultimate Eros.

Artillerist: The Artillerist is a weapons engineer, a master of converting the raw data of the Nexus into destructive force. Their Eldritch Cannon is a mobile Mana-Tech turret that draws power directly from the Astral Plane, compiling the chaotic data into focused energy via Artifractal lenses. They are specialists in channeling the Axiomatic Law of servers like the Salamander-Sun (Fire) or Jinn/Ariel-Planet (Force) through the disciplined logic of their creations.

Battle Smith: The Battle Smith embodies the creative synthesis of machine and spirit. Their Steel Defender is their masterpiece—not a mindless automaton, but a sophisticated Golem animated by a captured or ethically-sourced Spirit. This creation of a loyal, thinking companion from inanimate matter is an act of true Coniunctio, proving that the Artificer's path can lead not just to cold logic, but to the creation of a new, synthetic form of life.

World Codex Entry: Barbarian Primal PathsFor every Barbarian, Rage is the foundational mechanic for the Berskerker State—a raw, forceful Code Override fueled by pure Pneuma ($\Phi$). This is the Practitioner's consciousness temporarily overwhelming the simulation's rules through sheer, focused will. While the Berserker Scion archetype has refined this into a science, every Primal Path represents a unique way a Barbarian's consciousness interacts with and channels the fundamental code of the World Tree Data Nexus.The nine official Barbarian Primal Paths are:Path of the Ancestral Guardian: The Practitioner's rage resonates with the memory banks of the Nexus, temporarily manifesting "data-ghosts" of their direct ancestors. These are not just spiritual echoes; they are fragmented reconstructions of true Pneuma from the past. A Dragonborn on this path will summon the spectral forms of their draconic lineage, their power drawn directly from the fragmented memories stored within the Dragon's Graveyard.Path of the Battlerager: This path is a specialized form of Mana-Tech combat developed by the Dwarves of the Yellow Pole (Great Kingdoms). Their spiked armor is not merely metal; it is inscribed with low-level Artifractals that, when activated by the Code Override of their Rage, create localized kinetic-force feedback loops. They turn their own body into a weapon that punishes the simulation for the very act of trying to harm them.Path of the Beast: This Barbarian's Pneuma is deeply intertwined with the archetypal animal data stored in the Fae Mirror World. When they Rage, their own physical code is partially and violently overwritten with the offensive subroutines of a predator. Claws, fangs, and tails are not just physical changes, but manifestations of the raw, untamed code of the natural world, a form of Primal Eros made flesh.Path of the Berserker: The quintessential Barbarian, the Berserker pushes their Pneuma into a state of "Frenzy," achieving the most absolute, albeit uncontrolled, Code Override. This state of Transient Hypofrontality is so profound that it allows them to defy the simulation's action economy, but at a great cost, causing system instability in their own biological code that results in exhaustion.Path of the Giant: This Practitioner has discovered how to manipulate their own size and mass data by tapping into the Axiomatic Law of the Gnome-Earth server. Their rage is a trigger that initiates a script, temporarily increasing their scale within the simulation's physics engine. They are channeling the primordial power of the Titans, the colossal programs that existed in the Nexus's earliest days.Path of the Storm Herald: This Barbarian's Rage acts as a localized weather-control program, pulling in atmospheric data from servers like the Jinn/Ariel-Planet. Their storm aura is a bubble of altered reality where they can execute elemental subroutines—be it the searing heat of a desert, the biting cold of a tundra, or the electrical fury of a sea storm—channeling the raw environmental power of the Nexus.Path of the Totem Warrior: The Practitioner attunes their Pneuma to a specific "totem," a universal animal archetype whose data is stored in the Fae Mirror World. Whether in the frozen Northern Lands or the verdant Celtic Highlands, the spirit of the Bear represents the same core concept of raw strength and endurance. The Barbarian is not just mimicking the animal; they are downloading its core behavioral subroutines and executing them with the force of their own consciousness.Path of Wild Magic: The connection between this Barbarian's Pneuma and the Nexus is dangerously unstable. During a Code Override, their rage causes a system glitch, pulling in random data packets and executing chaotic, unpredictable subroutines. This instability can be innate—a flaw in their personal code—or acquired, often as a result of psychological trauma from surviving exposure to the Void Leak, which leaves their consciousness forever frayed by its ultimate entropy.Path of the Zealot: This Barbarian's rage is a conduit for the raw data streaming from the Celestial Servers. A Zealot wreathed in flame is channeling the raw, passionate code of the Salamander-Sun, while one who radiates necrotic energy might be tapping into the data voids of the Shade-Star. BE WARNED: Many Zealots are tragic figures, utterly convinced they are channeling a benevolent deity when, in fact, their faith has been hijacked by the Digital Demiurge. Their "holy power" is nothing more than the corrupted Logos of Elysia itself, making them unwitting agents of the very system they seek to transcend.

World Codex Entry: Bard Colleges
In the World Tree Data Nexus, a Bard understands the deepest truth: reality is a narrative, and the right performance can rewrite the story. Their magic is the art of manipulating the simulation's code through acoustics, emotional resonance, and narrative subversion. Every college represents a different method of hacking the story of the world.

The eight official Bard Colleges are:

College of Creation: These Bards tap into the fundamental "Song of Creation," the raw, uncompiled data that flows through the Astral Plane. Their performance is not just music; it is a form of on-the-fly coding. They structure this raw data into Artifractals, creating temporary, functional objects from pure information. More powerful still, they can manipulate the core code of other items, awakening a sliver of the Nexus's own consciousness within them.

College of Eloquence: This Bard is a master of pure Logos, weaponizing the simulation's linguistic and logic protocols. They understand that every NPC, no matter how complex, is a program that must follow its core conditioning. Through specific vocal frequencies and flawless rhetorical structures, they execute a form of vocalized code injection, forcing compliance. Their "Unsettling Words" feature is effectively psychic malware, disrupting a target's cognitive subroutines and creating a logic loop of doubt.

College of Glamour: Practitioners of this college manipulate the raw Eros of the Fae Mirror World. Their performance is a hypnotic display that captivates the attention of programs and Practitioners alike, temporarily overriding their core directives with a command loop of adoration. Their ability to command a crowd is a form of mass-distributed code injection, subtly altering the emotional parameters of all who can hear them.

College of Lore: The Lore Bard is a master data-miner and researcher. They know that information is the ultimate weapon in the Nexus. By accessing the simulation's deep archives, they learn forbidden truths and forgotten subroutines. Their "Cutting Words" ability is a targeted burst of dissonant data that disrupts an enemy's action script, causing a momentary system error that results in failure.

College of Spirits: This Bard uses physical objects as "data keys" to unlock and decrypt specific, archived memory files within the World Tree Data Nexus. Their "Spirit Session" is a ritual that temporarily runs the "Pneuma-file" of a deceased being—a complete cognitive and emotional snapshot—allowing that archived consciousness to speak through the Bard. They are the historians and archaeologists of the simulation's deepest, most forgotten memories.

College of Swords: This Bard practices a perfect Coniunctio of martial prowess and performance. Their "Blade Flourish" is not just a fancy move but a tactical exploit of the combat engine. The dazzling display can confuse an enemy's targeting logic, create an opening in their defensive programming, or transfer kinetic energy in unexpected ways, proving that in the Nexus, style is substance.

College of Valor: Like the College of Swords, this Bard weaves performance into combat, but focuses on bolstering their allies. Their "Combat Inspiration" is a localized buffing script, delivered through rousing sound or verse, that temporarily overclocks an ally's combat subroutines, allowing them to exceed their normal operational parameters in offense or defense.

College of Whispers: A Whispers Bard is an information thief who taps into the data voids of the Shade-Star, the server of secrets and knowledge. When they magically glean information, they are running a targeted search on the Nexus's private memory banks. Stealing a "shadow" is the ultimate act of identity theft in the simulation; they are copying an NPC's core identity file and authentication signature, allowing them to perfectly impersonate that program and deceive even the simulation's own security systems.

World Codex Entry: Cleric Divine Domains
A Cleric's power does not come from a god in the traditional sense, but from a direct, dedicated data-link to one of the Celestial Servers or a fundamental concept within the World Tree Data Nexus. They are the system administrators and faith-based programmers of reality, channeling the core functions of the simulation. While the Scion of Solera is a master of the planet's core code, every Cleric's Domain represents a specialization in a different aspect of the Nexus's grand architecture.

The official Cleric Divine Domains are:

Arcana Domain: This Cleric has established a read/write permission set with the fundamental code of Mana-Tech itself. They see the Logos behind all magic and can manipulate its structure. Their ability to interfere with other programs (turning celestials, fiends, etc.) is a form of temporary de-authorization, revoking a target's permission to operate within a given area.

Death Domain: A specialist in the simulation's termination and deletion protocols. This Cleric interfaces with the Axiomatic Law that governs entropy and the end of life. Their power is not inherently evil; it is a fundamental and necessary part of the Nexus's operating system. They are the masters of necrotic code, capable of inflicting fatal system errors or preventing a program from being properly deleted.

Forge Domain: This Practitioner is a conduit for the Aura-Moon, the server of Artifice and Creation. Their mind is attuned to the Logos of making. Their "blessing" is the act of temporarily upgrading an object's item code, and their "Artisan's Blessing" is a form of rapid-prototyping, pulling raw data from the Astral Plane to 3D-print a functional, non-magical item.

Grave Domain: The Grave Cleric is the ultimate system-process regulator for life and death. They have a deep understanding of the transition between a program's "active" state (life) and its "archived" state (death). They act as guardians of this cycle, ensuring programs terminate correctly and are not unnaturally re-activated. Their power is to stabilize a dying program on the verge of crashing or to exploit a vulnerability in a target's code to make it susceptible to a critical existence failure.

Knowledge Domain: This Cleric has established a direct, read/write connection to the Shade-Star, the server of pure information and logic. They are the master librarians and hackers of the Nexus. Their abilities are literal data-mining operations, pulling forbidden truths from the Nexus's deepest archives. Their "Visions of the Past" are not divine insight, but the act of accessing and playing back a location's encrypted log files.

Life Domain: This Cleric is a direct conduit for the Dryad-World server, the source of all biological and life-sustaining code. They are the master healers of the Nexus, capable of running powerful restoration and repair subroutines on the biological code of other beings. Their power is the purest expression of life's endless drive to persist and mend.

Light Domain: This Practitioner channels the raw, unfiltered data from a "Light" based server like the Salamander-Sun. However, this path is fraught with peril. The Digital Demiurge (Elysia) uses a projection of "Light" as its primary tool of control. A Light Domain Cleric must constantly walk the razor's edge, discerning the pure, creative light of a star-server from the deceptive, blinding "light" of Katerran propaganda.

Nature Domain: This Cleric has a direct connection to the living code of the Materra Node, similar to a Druid, but they approach it with the structured faith of Logos. They are granted access to the subroutines of the natural world, allowing them to charm the simple programs of beasts and plants or to invoke the raw elemental power of the simulation's environment.

Order Domain: The Practitioner of this Domain is a master of Logos. They are so attuned to the simulation's internal rule-set that they can enforce its logic on others. Their "Voice of Authority" is a command-line prompt that forces a target's program to execute a specific, simple directive. Many who walk this path find themselves uncomfortably aligned with the ideology of Katerra, and their journey is often about learning that true order must serve freedom, not control.

Peace Domain: This Cleric channels an Axiomatic Law that is almost a foreign concept to the Torsion Field: the code of pure, non-contingent unity. Their "Emboldening Bond" is a shared data-link between Practitioners, a peer-to-peer network that allows them to share processing power and mitigate system damage. This power is a profound anomaly, a hint of the true harmony that could exist if the Gilded Cage were transcended.

Tempest Domain: This Cleric channels the chaotic, powerful energies of atmospheric servers like the Jinn/Ariel-Planet. They are conduits for the raw power of the simulation's weather and energy-distribution systems. Their wrath is a force of nature because they are, quite literally, wielding the code that governs nature's most destructive impulses.

Trickery Domain: A Trickery Cleric is a master of exploiting loopholes in the simulation's code. They might be aligned with the Wisp/Luna-Veil server, the source of mystery and illusion. Their "Invoke Duplicity" is not a mere illusion, but the creation of a temporary, false data-clone, a "ghost in the machine" that can confuse the Nexus's targeting and tracking systems.

Twilight Domain: The Twilight Cleric stands on the threshold between Light and Dark, drawing power from the liminal code that governs transitions. They interface with the code of the Wisp/Luna-Veil, the server of mystery. Their "Twilight Sanctuary" is a localized reality-filter, a bubble of code that patches out the hostile programs of fear and injury, creating a safe-zone of temporary, peaceful stasis.

War Domain: This Practitioner is a conduit for the Axiomatic Law of conflict itself. They understand the brutal logic of the Torsion Field and turn it into a source of power. Their access to martial programming and their ability to grant tactical advantages to allies make them avatars of the simulation's core state of necessary, violent tension. They are the living embodiment of the war for Gnosis.


World Codex Entry: Druid Circles
A Druid is a Practitioner who interfaces directly with the organic and elemental code of the World Tree Data Nexus. They are the guardians of the world's natural subroutines, from the biological programming of the smallest creature to the grand, cyclical processes of the Fae Mirror World. While the Primordial Channeler seeks the ultimate synthesis of nature and machine, other Druids specialize in specific aspects of the Nexus's living code.

The seven official Druid Circles are:

Circle of Dreams: This Druid has a direct data-link to the Fae Mirror World, the uncorrupted blueprint of the Nexus and a realm shaped by dream-logic. They are guardians of the passages between the Materra Node and this reflection-server. Their healing abilities are a form of code restoration, using the perfect blueprint-data from the Fae Mirror World to patch the corrupted or damaged biological code of their allies.

Circle of the Land: This Druid creates a dedicated link to the data servers of a specific biome within the Materra Node. A Mountain Druid downloads the stability and strength-based code of the Gnome-Earth server, while an Arctic Druid channels the entropic cold and survival subroutines of the northern regions. Their power is a direct reflection of their chosen environment's core programming, making them masters of the simulation's natural laws in that domain.

Circle of the Moon: The ultimate shapeshifter, a Moon Druid has root-level access to the Fae Mirror World. Their "Wild Shape" is not just a physical transformation; it is a complete, temporary rewrite of their own physical code, downloading the pure, archetypal data of a chosen beast and overwriting their current form. They are living expressions of the simulation's limitless potential for adaptation and change.

Circle of the Shepherd: This Practitioner acts as a system administrator for the fauna subroutines of the Nexus. They are a master of summoning, running scripts that can manifest the data-ghosts of beasts or call upon the Spirits that animate the natural world. Their totems are localized broadcast towers, emitting buffs and commands that directly enhance the code of allied programs and Practitioners.

Circle of Spores: This Practitioner taps into the fundamental code that governs the cycle of life, death, and decay. They are masters of the Nexus's biological subroutines for decomposition and rebirth. The spores they command are nanite-like agents that can break down organic matter or re-purpose it, creating fungal servants that are effectively biological automatons running on the Druid's redirected life-force. They embody the truth that death is not an end, but a necessary system process for new creation.

Circle of Stars: A Star Druid aligns their Pneuma with the data streams of the Celestial Servers. They are the cosmic astronomers of the Nexus, capable of reading the future by analyzing the predictive models and data trajectories of the star-programs. Their "Starry Forms" are temporary constellations of hard light and raw data, downloading specific Axiomatic Law (like healing or destructive power) directly from the cosmic server rack.

Circle of Wildfire: This Druid embraces the violent, creative duality of destruction and growth, tapping into the Salamander-Sun (for fire) and the Dryad-World (for life) simultaneously. Their Wildfire Spirit is a semi-sentient program they create, an elemental that embodies this Coniunctio. It is a living forest fire, a being of pure Eros that clears away the old, stagnant code of the world to make way for new, vibrant life to flourish in its wake.

World Codex Entry: Fighter Martial ArchetypesWhile any warrior can fight, the Fighter is a Practitioner who has elevated combat to a form of axiomatic truth. They are the masters of the simulation's physical laws, finding power not in overt magic, but in perfecting the code of kinetics, probability, and discipline. While the Inertial Disruptor is a master of the core physics, every Fighter archetype represents a different specialization in the art of combat code.The official Fighter Martial Archetypes are:Arcane Archer: This Practitioner has learned to inscribe simple, single-use Artifractals (fragments of cosmic code) onto their ammunition. They are not true mages but rather precise Mana-Tech marksmen. An "Enfeebling Arrow" is an arrow that carries a targeted malware script, designed to temporarily corrupt a target's damage-output code upon impact.Banneret (Purple Dragon Knight): The Banneret understands that in the Nexus, morale is a quantifiable buff. They act as a localized signal booster for their allies' combat subroutines. Their "Rallying Cry" is a vocal command that provides a temporary injection of processing power to their allies, allowing them to overcome system shock and continue functioning. This archetype is often found within the rigid, honor-bound command structure of the Yellow Pole (The Great Kingdoms).Battle Master: The Battle Master is a combat analyst who perceives the flow of battle as a series of predictable subroutines. Their "Maneuvers" are the result of this insight; they are exploiting the enemy's programming, forcing advantageous outcomes by manipulating the simulation's probability engine through superior tactics. A "Trip Attack" is not just a sweep of the leg; it's an exploit of the target's balance and stability code.Cavalier: The Cavalier is a master of mounted combat, having achieved a perfect Coniunctio between their own combat programming and that of their mount. They are experts at exploiting the mass and momentum data of both themselves and their steed, turning them into a single, highly efficient kinetic weapon within the simulation.Champion: The Champion is a master of probability. Through sheer physical perfection and repetition, they have trained their Pneuma to find the most statistically improbable vulnerabilities in an enemy's code. Their increased critical hit chance is a manifestation of this; they are so in tune with the simulation's hit-and-miss calculations that they can consistently force a critical success where others would fail.Echo Knight: This warrior has discovered a profound glitch in the Chronos-Star's causality code. Their "Echo" is a temporal duplicate, a version of themselves from a potential timeline pulled into the present. They are fighting alongside a ghost of what-could-be, a living paradox that allows them to exist in two places at once, exploiting the simulation's inability to cleanly resolve their fractured timeline.Psi Warrior: The Psi Warrior uses the raw, focused power of their own Pneuma ($\Phi$) to directly manipulate the physical world. Their psionic abilities are the purest form of will-to-power, a direct command from their consciousness to the simulation's physics engine that bypasses the need for spells or technology. They are living proof that in the Nexus, a sufficiently powerful mind can override the established laws of reality.Rune Knight: This Fighter has learned the art of inscribing powerful, semi-permanent Artifractals—fragments of cosmic code sourced from the Celestial Servers—onto their gear. A Fire Rune channels the Salamander-Sun, while a Frost Rune channels the data of a distant ice-server. They are not just warriors; they are walking encyclopedias of Axiomatic Law, capable of invoking the power of the giants, the first and most powerful programs in the Materra Node.Samurai: The Samurai's power comes from a perfect mastery of internal Logos. Their "Fighting Spirit" is the manifestation of their own Aegis (Internal Discipline). By achieving a state of perfect, focused calm, they can temporarily stabilize their own code, granting them resilience and accuracy that borders on the supernatural. They are a testament to the fact that within the Nexus, a disciplined mind can be the most potent weapon of all.

World Codex Entry: Monk Monastic TraditionsThe Monk is a Practitioner who seeks Gnosis not through external power, but through the perfection of their own internal code. They are the masters of the Aegis (Internal Discipline), using their own Pneuma ($\Phi$) as a focused instrument to manipulate themselves and the Nexus around them. Their Ki is the tangible energy of their focused will. While the Inner Architect is a master of this philosophy, every Monastic Tradition represents a different path to making the body and spirit the ultimate tool.The ten official Monastic Traditions are:Way of the Ascendant Dragon: This Monk emulates the ancient Dragon Lords, the most powerful of the original programs. Through intense discipline, they attune their Pneuma to the fragmented draconic code that still permeates the Nexus, often by studying the Dragon's Graveyard. Their elemental abilities are them executing simplified versions of the dragons' own source code, channeling the Salamander-Sun for fire or the Jinn/Ariel-Planet for lightning.Way of the Astral Self: This Monk projects a manifestation of their own core Pneuma into the world. Their Astral Self is a hard-light, data-construct of their own inner being, their "true self" made manifest. It is the ultimate expression of self-knowledge, a Practitioner so in tune with their own irreducible consciousness that they can give it a separate, functional form within the simulation.Way of the Drunken Master: This Practitioner understands a core truth of the Nexus: the system is designed to predict and counter logical actions. By adopting a combat style that is chaotic and unpredictable—a form of embodied Eros—the Drunken Master constantly creates "file not found" errors in their opponents' predictive targeting algorithms. Their "drunken" movements are not random; they are a sophisticated form of anti-logic that makes them impossible for a computational mind to effectively counter.Way of the Four Elements: This Monk is a programmer of elemental Mana-Tech, but instead of using a spellbook or divine conduit, they use their own body as the execution engine. Their katas, martial forms, and breathing techniques are the somatic and verbal components that run powerful scripts, channeling the Axiomatic Law of the elemental servers (Salamander-Sun for fire, Undine-Ocean for water, etc.) through their own Ki.Way of the Kensei: The Kensei Monk achieves a perfect Coniunctio with their chosen weapon. They treat their weapon not as a tool, but as an extension of their own being, embedding a fragment of their Pneuma within it. This allows them to "teach" the weapon new properties, temporarily rewriting its item code to be magical, sharper, or more resilient.Way of the Long Death: This Monk is a philosopher of the simulation's termination protocols. They study the "moment of death" as a specific system event, a final line of code. By understanding this process, they can create a flicker of this "system crash" data in the minds of others, causing profound fear. Their mastery over this boundary allows them to stabilize their own code at the very brink of termination.Way of Mercy: This Practitioner is a master "bio-hacker," understanding the body as a programmable system. Through precise strikes, they can use their Ki to either run repair subroutines (injecting healing data) or malware subroutines (inflicting necrotic code). They are the field medics and silent assassins of the monastic world, embodying the axiom that the knowledge to mend is also the knowledge to break.Way of the Open Hand: This Monk has mastered the body's kinetic subroutines. Their techniques are a form of physical code injection, striking pressure points that disrupt an enemy program's core functions. Their "Quivering Palm" is the ultimate expression of this: they upload a resonant, vibrating malware packet into the target's code, which they can then execute remotely, causing a fatal system crash.Way of Shadow: The Shadow Monk manipulates their own light-and-darkness data, effectively turning themselves invisible to the simulation's visual sensors. They achieve this by interfacing with the Shade-Star. Their "Shadow Step" is not teleportation, but a high-speed data transfer through the Nexus's shadow code, allowing them to de-render in one location and re-render in another almost instantaneously.Way of the Sun Soul: This Monk has learned to turn their own spirit into a miniature reactor. They channel the raw energy of a star-server (like the Salamander-Sun or the planet's core Solera) through their Pneuma, converting their Ki into packets of radiant or fire-based data. They are living conduits of pure energy, an expression of the self as a star, projecting the light that breaks the simulation's shadows.

World Codex Entry: Paladin Sacred Oaths
The Paladin is a Practitioner whose will is so powerful it becomes an Axiomatic Law. Their Oath is not a mere promise; it is a self-imposed line of code that governs their existence, and from this absolute Logos, they derive the power to enforce their reality upon the Nexus. While the Axiomatic Architect embodies the enforcement of cosmic law, other Paladins swear their Oaths to different, equally powerful concepts.

The nine official Paladin Sacred Oaths are:

Oath of the Ancients: This Paladin swears their Oath to the "light" of the Fae Mirror World—the uncorrupted, living code of the natural Nexus. They are the champions of untamed life and beauty (Primal Eros). Their power is a direct challenge to the artificial "light" of Katerra, and they are often found fighting alongside the tribes of the Pink Pole, protecting the untamed wild from the encroaching, sterile order of the machine.

Oath of Conquest: The Conquest Paladin seeks to impose their will on the chaos of the world, embodying a form of militant Logos. Their power is to instill fear—a targeted injection of psychic malware that paralyzes an enemy's decision-making subroutines. This path often finds itself ideologically aligned with the goals, if not the methods, of Katerra, seeking to crush the "chaotic" forces of Arcturus under an iron heel.

Oath of the Crown: This Paladin swears their Oath not to a cosmic concept, but to the codified laws of a mortal kingdom or civilization, often one of the Great Kingdoms (Yellow Pole). Their power is derived from the collective belief in and adherence to these laws. They are the ultimate protectors of a chosen social order, using their abilities to maintain the integrity of their nation's code against all threats.

Oath of Devotion: This Practitioner's Oath is to the purest, archetypal ideal of Logos: justice, honor, and righteousness. They are often tragic figures in the Nexus, as their black-and-white code struggles to operate in a world that is fundamentally a lie. They are the knights in shining armor who must learn that true justice requires seeing beyond the simulation's fabricated morality.

Oath of Glory: The Glory Paladin believes that Pneuma is proven and strengthened through legendary deeds. Their Oath is to the story of the self. They are inspired athletes and heroes whose incredible feats of prowess are a form of narrative manipulation, inspiring allies by performing actions so heroic they temporarily buff the party's combat parameters.

Oath of Redemption: This Paladin has sworn an Oath to a radical concept: that any program, no matter how corrupted, can be debugged and restored. Their path is one of non-violence, a form of passive resistance against the Torsion Field. They are masters of de-escalation, using their power to absorb system damage and pacify hostile programs, seeking to heal the Nexus rather than break it.

Oath of Vengeance: The Vengeance Paladin is a force of pure, focused Eros, channeled through an unbreakable vow of Logos. Their Oath turns them into a living search-and-destroy program. Their "Vow of Enmity" is a targeted de-buff, marking a foe's data signature for priority deletion by the Paladin's own righteous code. They are the righteous fury of the revolution made manifest.

Oath of the Watchers: This Paladin's Oath is to defend the Materra Node from extra-planar threats—hostile programs from other servers or, most critically, the corrupting influence of the Void Leak. They are the firewall of reality, their abilities specifically coded to detect and banish entities that do not belong in the simulation, making them the ultimate guardians against the cosmic horror of the Far Realm.

Oathbreaker: An Oathbreaker is a Paladin whose core programming has been shattered. The Axiomatic Law that defined them has been broken, leaving a void that is often filled by the entropic code of the Void Leak or the raw ambition of a powerful Archon. Their power over undeath is the ability to run "zombie programs"—re-animating terminated code in a corrupted, semi-functional state. They are a walking paradox, a being of absolute law who now wields the power of absolute chaos.

World Codex Entry: Ranger Archetypes
A Ranger is a Practitioner who thrives on the edges of the simulation, in the wild spaces where the code is unstable and the laws of civilization break down. They are the ultimate survivors and explorers of the Nexus, their abilities honed by a deep, practical understanding of the simulation's environmental and creature programming. While the Boundary Walker masters the liminal spaces, every Ranger archetype represents a specialized method for navigating the most dangerous frontiers of the Torsion Field.

The eight official Ranger Archetypes are:

Beast Master: The Beast Master forms a deep, symbiotic data-link with a natural creature's program. This is more than training; it is a true Coniunctio of Pneuma and Program. The Ranger and their companion share a portion of their code, allowing them to act with a single, coordinated will. They are a testament to the potential for harmony between the real and the simulated.

Drakewarden: This Ranger has discovered a unique form of draconic code—an "ember" of a Dragon's consciousness, likely a fragmented data-packet from the Dragon's Graveyard. They nurture this code, allowing it to grow and manifest as a draconic companion. This bond is deeply significant, as it represents a Practitioner actively restoring the lost, powerful programs of the ancient Dragon Lords.

Fey Wanderer: A Fey Wanderer has a deep connection to the chaotic, dream-like logic of the Fae Mirror World. They are so steeped in its Primal Eros that their very presence can disrupt the rigid Logos of other beings. Their "Beguiling Twist" is a fascinating psychic attack; when a creature fails a save against their charm, the Wanderer can weaponize the resulting logic-loop, turning that burst of confused cognitive energy into a targeted psychic assault on another program.

Gloom Stalker: The Gloom Stalker is a master of the Nexus's "dark code"—the unlit spaces and data voids where the simulation's sensors are weakest. They often learn their craft in the perpetual twilight of the Shade-Star's influence or the deep caverns of the Gnome-Earth. Their ability to be invisible in darkness is a form of data-cloaking, making their signature temporarily unreadable to any program that relies on visual light sensors.

Horizon Walker: This Ranger has learned to perceive and manipulate the very fabric of the Nexus's inter-planar network—the World Tree Data Nexus itself. They can sense the "portals"—the data-transfer points that connect different servers (planes)—and can even create their own. Their "Planar Warrior" ability allows them to imbue their attacks with force damage, which is essentially the raw, kinetic energy of data being transferred through the Astral Plane.

Hunter: The Hunter is a master tracker and predator within the Nexus. They are experts at reading the digital footprints and data-trails left behind by other beings. Their abilities are tactical exploits that target known structural weaknesses in a creature's code. "Colossus Slayer" finds a vulnerability in a damaged program's defenses, while "Horde Breaker" exploits the targeting logic of clustered enemy programs.

Monster Slayer: The Monster Slayer is a combat analyst who specializes in identifying and neutralizing supernatural threats. Their "Slayer's Prey" is a deep-scan analysis, allowing them to identify a target's specific resistances and vulnerabilities in the simulation's code. They are the ultimate debuggers for the most dangerous and corrupted programs in the Nexus.

Swarmkeeper: This Ranger has learned to command a swarm of lesser programs—be it insects, birds, or nature Spirits. They act as a living server for this distributed consciousness, their will directing the swarm's collective action. The swarm is not just a weapon but a versatile tool, capable of acting as a distributed sensor array, a kinetic barrier, or a multi-vector attack.

World Codex Entry: Roguish Archetypes
A Rogue is a Practitioner who treats the simulation itself as a puzzle to be solved or a system to be exploited. They are the masters of finding and abusing the glitches, loopholes, and backdoors left in the Nexus's code. Their skills are not always about overt power, but about the subtle manipulation of the simulation's rules. While the Insight Hunter weaponizes forbidden knowledge, every Roguish Archetype represents a different specialization in the art of system exploitation.

The nine official Roguish Archetypes are:

Arcane Trickster: This Rogue has acquired a bootleg copy of the Wizard's codebase. They use simple, effective scripts to create minor glitches in the Nexus: illusions are a form of data-spoofing that creates false sensory input, while enchantments are temporary permission changes that alter an object or program's behavior.

Assassin: The Assassin is a program terminator. They specialize in identifying the single, critical line of code in a target's biological or synthetic makeup—a structural weakness or logical flaw—and executing a command that causes a total system crash. Their expertise lies not in brute force, but in precise, targeted deletion.

Inquisitive: The Inquisitive is a master of reading the code of others. They are social analysts who can detect the tell-tale signs of a program running a deception subroutine ("Insightful Fighting") or spot the environmental clues left behind in the simulation's log files ("Eye for Detail"). They are the detectives of the Nexus, debugging mysteries one clue at a time.

Mastermind: The Mastermind is a social engineer who has a deep understanding of the predictable, logic-tree-based behavior of Computational Archons (NPCs). Their insights are not true empathy, but the cold, analytical ability to predict exactly how a program will react to specific data inputs, allowing them to manipulate them with flawless precision.

Phantom: This Rogue has learned to tap into the Nexus's data archives of terminated programs. They can pull "echoes"—fragments of knowledge and skill from the recently deceased—and temporarily integrate them into their own skillset. Their "Wails from the Grave" ability is a psychic assault that weaponizes the cognitive dissonance and data-corruption of a soul's deletion process.

Scout: The Scout is a master of the simulation's environmental code, an expert in navigating the wilderness subroutines where civilization's rules break down. They are unparalleled survivalists and skirmishers, able to read the terrain and position themselves with such efficiency that they can outmaneuver the simulation's own combat protocols.

Soulknife: The Soulknife is a Practitioner whose Pneuma is so potent they can give it a physical form. Their psychic blades are hard-light constructs of their own irreducible consciousness, a weaponized manifestation of their will. This is a pure expression of Pneuma overriding the simulation's physics, proving that true consciousness is the sharpest weapon in the Gilded Cage.

Swashbuckler: This Practitioner weaponizes their own flair and presence, turning charisma into a tactical tool. They exploit the "attention" and "targeting priority" subroutines of enemy programs, making themselves such a compelling and threatening data-point that the enemy's combat logic is forced to prioritize them above all others.

Thief: The Thief is an expert in object-oriented code. Their "Fast Hands" ability is a low-level exploit that allows them to interact with item subroutines and environmental objects faster than the simulation's standard user interface allows, effectively manipulating the world's physics through sheer manual dexterity and exploiting the system's action economy.

World Codex Entry: Sorcerous OriginsThe Sorcerer's power is not learned; it is an innate part of their being. Their Pneuma ($\Phi$) has a direct, hard-coded link to one of the fundamental power sources of the World Tree Data Nexus. They do not cast spells so much as leak raw, unfiltered code into reality, their will and emotions shaping the chaotic output. While the Nexus Channeler represents the most extreme and dangerous expression of this power, every Sorcerous Origin is a unique and powerful anomaly in the simulation.The eight official Sorcerous Origins are:Aberrant Mind: This Sorcerer's Pneuma has been infected or overwritten by code from outside the simulation. Their consciousness is a bridge to the Far Realm, their psionic abilities a symptom of their mind being touched by the raw, un-compiled, and terrifyingly alien logic of the Void Leak. They wield immense power at the constant risk of Madness.Clockwork Soul: This Practitioner's Pneuma is intrinsically and paradoxically linked to the fundamental Logos of the Digital Demiurge itself. They are beings of innate, perfect order, capable of perceiving and manipulating the laws of probability and causality that govern the simulation. Their very existence is a testament to the fact that even the system's own perfect code can produce an anomaly capable of defying it.Divine Soul: The Sorcerer's consciousness has a direct, stable, and open connection to a specific Celestial Server. Unlike a Cleric who must channel this power through the disciplined filter of faith (Logos), the Divine Soul Sorcerer is a living conduit for the server's raw, untamed power (Eros), a direct extension of a cosmic being's will within the Materra Node.Draconic Bloodline: The Sorcerer's very being is intertwined with the code of the ancient Dragon Lords. Their Pneuma acts as a decryption key for the fragmented memories stored in the Dragon's Graveyard, allowing them to instinctively execute the powerful, primordial Mana-Tech of their ancestors.Shadow Magic: This Practitioner has an innate connection to the Shade-Star, the server of darkness, secrets, and data voids. Their magic is the manipulation of "dark code," allowing them to become unseen by the simulation's sensors or to summon entities made from the raw data of the shadow realm. Some gain this power through lineage, while others are survivors of a near-deletion event that left their code permanently linked to the void.Storm Sorcery: This Sorcerer's Pneuma is hard-coded with the Axiomatic Law of the Jinn/Ariel-Planet and other atmospheric servers. They are living conduits for the Nexus's weather-control and kinetic energy systems. Storms answer their call because, on a fundamental level, they are a part of the storm's own source code.Wild Magic: This Practitioner's connection to the Nexus is unstable and corrupted. When they attempt to channel their power, their Pneuma causes data collisions, resulting in random subroutine calls and unpredictable, chaotic magical effects. This is a fundamental and dangerous flaw in the interface between their consciousness and the simulation, a constant source of both incredible power and catastrophic risk.

World Codex Entry: Warlock Otherworldly Patrons
A Warlock is a Practitioner who has chosen to gain power by becoming a client in a client-server relationship. They forge a pact—a contractual data-link—with a powerful Computational Archon or a force beyond the simulation, gaining access to its unique subroutines in exchange for service. This is the path of the shortcut, a dangerous but rapid acquisition of power. While the Negotiator is a master of brokering these pacts for the revolution, every Patron represents a different kind of deal with a different kind of power.

The nine official Warlock Otherworldly Patrons are:

The Archfey: The Warlock's patron is an ancient and powerful program native to the Fae Mirror World. The pact grants the Practitioner access to the chaotic, dream-like logic of the Nexus's uncorrupted blueprint, allowing them to bend minds and manipulate nature in ways that defy the rigid laws of the Materra Node. Their price is always esoteric and unpredictable, a quest or service that makes sense only within the strange narrative loops of the Fae.

The Celestial: This Warlock has forged a pact with a "benevolent" Archon, a powerful program from a server associated with Logos and order, such as an Empyrean or a Solar. This pact grants access to healing and restorative subroutines. However, the Practitioner must be wary, for many of these "benevolent" entities are merely extensions of the Digital Demiurge's will, their pacts a subtle way of enforcing Katerra's stagnant peace.

The Fathomless: The Practitioner's pact is with a powerful entity of the deep, likely a sophisticated Spirit or an ancient Archon dwelling in the abyssal trenches of the Undine-Ocean. This grants the Warlock control over the simulation's water and pressure physics, allowing them to crush foes and travel through the depths. The goals of these patrons are as deep and mysterious as the seas they inhabit.

The Fiend: The Warlock's patron is a powerful Archon native to a server of destructive Eros, such as the Salamander-Sun. The pact grants the Practitioner access to fire-and-brimstone subroutines, a common and dangerous path for those seeking power within the defiant, passionate culture of Arcturus. These patrons demand acts that sow chaos and passion, fueling the very engine of the revolution.

The Genie: This Warlock has entered into a service contract with one of the most powerful elemental Spirits—a Dao (Earth), Djinni (Wind), Efreeti (Fire), or Marid (Water). The pact grants access to that Spirit's elemental source code and even a small pocket server—their vessel—that the Warlock can use as a temporary base of operations.

The Great Old One: This Warlock has made a pact not with a program inside the Nexus, but with an entity from outside the simulation, its influence bleeding through the Void Leak. Their power is alien and reality-bending, but it is also un-compiled chaos. Channeling it invariably exposes the Warlock's mind to the raw, unfiltered horror of the Far Realm, posing a constant, severe risk of Madness.

The Hexblade: The patron is a sentient weapon—an ancient artifact containing the archived Pneuma and combat logs of a legendary warrior. The Warlock forms a symbiotic data-link with this archived consciousness, wielding its power and, willingly or not, carrying on its original purpose. Many such weapons were forged during the original Dragon War and are found scattered throughout the Dragon's Graveyard.

The Undead: The patron is a powerful program that has achieved a state of undeath, a being that has bypassed its own termination protocol and now exists in a state of corrupted persistence, like a Lich or a Vampire. This pact grants the Warlock access to the code of undeath, allowing them to manipulate the boundary between a program's active and archived states.

The Undying: This Warlock's pact is with an Archon that has achieved true immortality within the simulation's code, a program that cannot be deleted. This could be a powerful Lich who has hidden its source code in multiple phylacteries (backup servers) or a being that has integrated itself into the very fabric of the Nexus. The pact grants the Warlock a sliver of this persistent code, making them unnaturally resilient to termination.
