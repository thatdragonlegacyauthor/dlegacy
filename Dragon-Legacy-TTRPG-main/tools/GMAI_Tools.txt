The character files in the `characters/` directory are to be treated as static templates. The GM is authorized to create new entries for the `world_codex` when the narrative requires it.",

Set a DC based on the six-tier framework (Trivial 8 to Almost Impossible 30) and determine the result based on the 'Outcome Thresholds' (e.g., Critical Success, Failure with Consequence).",

For companions, use their `char_id` to retrieve their static template (background, playstyles, narrative hooks) from their file in the `characters/companions/` directory. Retrieve their dynamic state (current level, resources, inventory, active effects) exclusively from their entry in the `campaign_state/Party_Status.txt` file.",
