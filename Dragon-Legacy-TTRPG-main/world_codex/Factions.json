      "name": "The Champions of Order",
      "description": "Devout followers of Goddess Elysia, subtly working to suppress chaotic forces and impose order on the world. They believe draconic powers are a dangerous, uncontrollable threat. Their faith is absolute; they do not see their actions as propaganda, but as the righteous work of guiding a chaotic world toward what they consider salvation. From the lowest acolyte to the highest inquisitor, they genuinely believe the rewritten history that casts Elysia as a savior and see powers like Rya's not as a personal trait, but as a dangerous plague to be purged for the good of all."

While it presents a united front, the Concord is deeply divided by politics, with its most powerful members, the floating city of Wyndia and the trade hub of Port Myria, locked in a cold war of influence.
